My name is Sayantan Lahiri.
I have recently graduated as metallurgical and material engineer from Jadavpur University, Kolkata.
Even though I am from a core engineering branch,
the variety of technologies that are being used in the information technology sphere has motivated me to start my career in the IT domain.
I am lucky to have the opportunity to start my IT career at Larsen & Toubro Infotech.
I am mainly interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning technologies.
